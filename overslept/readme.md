# Overslept
## Summary
Every college student, especially in JMU, can relate to oversleeping and hurrying to class. Overslept is a game where you control a player who randomly starts at a dorm and is given instruction to what building on JMU campus is his/her class in. The student then needs to race against the time to make it on class on time. This game will support two players, who can go head-to-head and race each other to see who makes it to class first.

## Tech
This game will require the following:
- The 3D terrain of JMU campus (Google Earth)
- Obstacles such as walking students, buses, and cars
- Walking students and the players would need walk/run animations
- For multiple players, split-screen would be implemented
- This will be a first-person game, but with the cameras right in front of the avatar so the player can see the other
- Collision detection so the player isn't able to climb over obstacles such as buildings, trees, NPCs, cars, etc
- An overlay with a timer showing the destination, time, and goal/class start time
- A menu to start, pause, and restart the current game
- Inputs would be done through two separately connected controllers
